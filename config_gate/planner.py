"""
planner.py — the VLM PLANNER: context (+ optionally a frame) -> a watch-spec.

The VLM-first half of the new architecture (see relation_table.md). SINGLE SOURCE for the
planner prompt and watch-spec schema, used by BOTH the preliminary study and the future
live system — whatever the study tunes is exactly what ships.

TWO GRAMMARS (a study arm, not a design decision — see planner_study.py):
  restricted : watch = up to 3 entries; each entry = AND over 1-3 relation ids + a time
               window. Entries are alternatives (OR). Simple, easy to validate & execute.
  free       : each entry may combine  all (AND) / any (OR) / not (suppression) /
               then (ordered sequence)  — more expressive, bigger error surface.
Both schemas carry a "missing" field: if the context needs a relation the vocabulary
lacks, the model must SAY SO (the empirical coverage probe for the table).

Offline mode (SECONDATTN_OFFLINE=1): deterministic fake specs, keyless plumbing runs.

Choose AT MOST 3 entries, ranked most important first. Conjunctions are rarer and more
meaningful than single relations — prefer them when the context genuinely pairs signals,
but a single relation is the right answer when it alone carries the news.
