"""
perceive.py — STABLE perception: a frame -> a scene graph with stable relations.

This is the linchpin the rest of the pipeline stands on. The whole point (see the
discussion / FINDINGS): the GATE needs a relational encoding that is *stable* across
frames, or it can never habituate ("same situation" must map to "same graph"). VLMs and
learned SGG models do NOT give stable relations (they relabel per frame — the
scientist/researcher/student flip-flop, PE-Net's intra/inter-class problem). So we get
stability the cheap, boring, reliable way:

    off-the-shelf OBJECT detection (stable boxes)  +  GEOMETRIC relations by rule.

The VLM is NOT used here; it is the downstream judgment brain. Object identity comes from
a detector (mature, consistent); relations come from geometry (deterministic), not from a
model guessing predicates.

ROTATION NOTE (found in the real lab frames): the camera sits on a pan/tilt head, so frames
arrive tilted/sideways. "on / above / below" assume a known up-direction and become
unreliable when the view is rotated. So relations split into:
  - rotation-INVARIANT (always safe): near, touching/overlapping, inside/contains
  - direction (needs an up-vector): on, above, below, left_of, right_of
The pan/tilt pose can supply `up`; without it we emit only the invariant relations.

The detector is a pluggable ADAPTER. The default is a MockDetector for testing the graph
logic here; on the rig you drop in YOLO-World (open-vocab, no hand-listed objects — matches
the brief) / Grounding DINO / YOLOv8. See `YoloWorldDetector` stub at the bottom.
