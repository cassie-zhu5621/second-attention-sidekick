"""
watch_exec.py — executes a planner watch-spec over the per-frame truth vector.

Semantics (the contract with planner.py / relation_table.md):
  - a relation id is HELD at time t if it has been True for >= `persist` consecutive
    frames, and its last held-moment is within the entry's `within_s` window.
  - entry fields:  all  — every id held within the window
                   any  — at least one id held within the window
                   not  — NONE of these held within the window (suppression)
                   then — ids BECAME held in this order, all within the window
  - entries in `watch` are alternatives (OR): each can fire independently.
  - `single_ok` ids act as 1-id entries with the default window.
  - a fired entry enters `cooldown` seconds of habituation (same moment != news twice);
    holding a satisfied entry does NOT re-fire it — it must break, then re-form.

All timing is in SECONDS (fps-independent: M5 ~2fps and a 30fps webcam both work).
